<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Today karbytes used the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a> chatbot Playground web interface by entering text into a text field and clicking a submit button after typing in plain-text input. AI-generated plain text output is generated within approximately three seconds of karbytes pressing the submit button. What follows is a transcript of karbytes interacting with the chatbot through a web page interface which implements the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_210/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT API service</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Note that the <span style="background:#00ff00">green</span> highlighted text was generated by the artificial intelligence which karbytes was interacting with and not by karbytes.</em></strong></p>
<p>(Note that the image displayed beneath the chatlog is a screenshot of karbyteâ€™s initial month usage of the OpenAI API).</p>
