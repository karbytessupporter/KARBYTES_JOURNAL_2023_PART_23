<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Today karbytes used the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a> chatbot Playground web interface by entering text into a text field and clicking a submit button after typing in plain-text input. AI-generated plain text output is generated within approximately three seconds of karbytes pressing the submit button. What follows is a transcript of karbytes interacting with the chatbot through a web page interface which implements the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_210/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT API service</a>.</span></p>

<p>How many websites are there currently on the World Wide Web total?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">It is impossible to say with certainty, as the exact number of websites on the World Wide Web is constantly changing. However, according to estimates from Internet Live Stats, there are over 1.8 billion websites as of July 2020.</span></p>
<p>How many WordPress websites are there currently on the World Wide Web?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">According to W3Techs, there are currently over 33% of all websites on the World Wide Web that are powered by WordPress. This means that there are approximately 600 million WordPress websites on the World Wide Web.</span></p>
<p>How popular is <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a> compared to all other WordPress websites which are currently on the World Wide Web?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Unfortunately, it is not possible to measure the relative popularity of <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a> compared to other WordPress websites on the World Wide Web. Ranking or popularity is determined by a variety of factors, such as the number of visitors, the amount of time spent on the website, and the number of backlinks.</span></p>
<p>How many different countries (and which countries) ever visited that website?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">It is not possible to answer this question without access to the website&#8217;s analytics data. However, if you are the owner of the website, you can use Google Analytics to track the countries that have visited your website.</span></p>
<p>How many web pages are in that website?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">It is not possible to answer this question without access to the website itself. However, if you are the owner of the website, you can use a tool such as Screaming Frog to crawl the website and determine the exact number of web pages.</span></p>
<p>Summarize the following: The following paragraph depicts the author of this website (whose most personally preferred name is karbytes) declaring to itself (and to the general public) what karbytes’ primary self-defined goals are.</p>
<p>karbytes: “As an information processing agent whose species is tentatively self-defined as ‘human-to-cyborg’ (which is an arbitrary and informal term for labeling humans who engage in transhumanist evolution), my primary goals are (a (most importantly)) to maximize the temporal length of my personal and apparently unique continuity of consciousness (i.e. which is a non-ubiquitous allocation of the ubiquitous and featureless substrate which karbytes tentatively believes is pure consciousness observing a particular configuration of multiple phenomena which appear and which disappear inside of exactly one solipsistic space-time continuum which my personal and apparently unique continuity of consciousness observes to occur in exactly one chronological order and (b (second most importantly)) to recurrently instantiate the intellectual property which comprises this website such that the intellectual property is preserved and able to be reconstituted as public domain software (which is encoded as and decoded from a particular finite linear sequence of binary digits) from the perspective of exactly one ‘humanoid’ (i.e. arbitrarily human-like information processing agent) viewing that website (after that website was most recently updated and such that karbytes’ approved of that update) for some nonnegative integer (which that humanoid prefers) number of times per finite positive real number constant length of time which elapses according to that humanoid’s frame of reference.”</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">karbytes has two primary goals: (1) to maintain their continuity of consciousness, and (2) to preserve their intellectual property in the form of public domain software. They are working to achieve these goals from the perspective of a &#8220;humanoid information processing agent&#8221; who is viewing the website for a certain amount of time.</span></p>
<p>Summarize the following: NATURE</p>
<p>The following terms and their respective definitions describe nature (i.e. the whole of reality) as being the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness.</p>
<p>NOTHINGNESS: the ubiquitous, featureless, irreducible, and immutable substrate into which all phenomena are projected.</p>
<p>According to panpsychism (i.e. the hypothesis which posits that the entirety of nature is contained inside of one ubiquitous mind and that each phenomenon is a component of some dream which that mind constructs and experiences), pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness (which means that nature is fundamentally sentient and that consciousness (i.e. awareness (i.e. sentience)) is not an emergent property of sufficiently complex physical structures, but instead, the fundamental substrate which encompasses and which constitutes all physical structures).</p>
<p>PHENOMENON: (plural: phenomena) a finite region of space which is distinguishable from pure nothingness due to the fact that the finite region of space is perceived (by some frame of reference) as containing specific quantifiable features.</p>
<p>An example of a relatively “low level” (i.e. reductionist) phenomenon is a light sensor inside of an electronic circuit detecting incoming light whose wavelengths are exactly 700 nanometers and not some other wavelength such as 470 nanometers.</p>
<p>(Human nervous systems perceive light whose wavelengths are between 625 and 740 nanometers as the color red. By contrast, human nervous systems perceive light whose wavelengths are between 450 and 495 nanometers as the color blue).</p>
<p>A human nervous system which is perceiving a particular color even without knowing the exact frequency of the light which is being perceived by that human nervous system is a relatively “high level” (i.e. holistic) example of a phenomenon.</p>
<p>FRAME_OF_REFERENCE: an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena.</p>
<p>(A partial rather than omniscient frame of reference experiences the passage of time and time as progressing in exactly one direction (from past to future while the partial frame of reference functions as a barrier between past and future while that partial frame of reference appears to itself to be dwelling in the present) and such that a relatively fixed rate of finite (in scope) spatial frames per second are being rendered by that partial frame of reference).</p>
<p>(An omniscient rather than partial frame of reference would simultaneously render all partial frames of reference from a perspective which transcends all space-time continuums).</p>
<p>NOUMENON: (plural: noumena) a specific phenomenon which is not being observed by some partial frame of reference (according to that particular frame of reference).</p>
<p>Suppose that two unique and partial frames of reference exist and that one of those frames of reference, A, is observing some phenomenon, X, while the other frame of reference, B, is not observing X. Then, according to B, X is a noumenon.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Nature is the set which contains all phenomena, all noumena, and all of pure nothingness. Panpsychism states that pure nothingness is synonymous with pure consciousness, and that consciousness is the fundamental substrate encompassing and constituting all physical structures. Phenomena are finite regions of space that are distinguishable from pure nothingness, and can be either &#8220;low level&#8221; (reductionist) or &#8220;high level&#8221; (holistic). A frame of reference is an allocation of pure nothingness which renders specific phenomena, and a noumenon is a phenomenon that is not observed by a particular frame of reference.</span></p>
<p>Can you count the number of words on a web page if I give you the URL for that web page?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Yes, it is possible to count the number of words on a web page if you have access to the URL for that web page. You can use a tool such as Webpage Word Count to count the number of words on the page.</span></p>
<p>Is <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a> banned in any countries or by any search engines?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">At this time, there is no indication that <a href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/</a> is banned in any countries or by any search engines.</span></p>
<p>List an example of a bannaed website.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">An example of a banned website is 8chan, which is a website that was previously used to promote hate speech and extremism. In August 2019, 8chan was banned by the U.S. government in response to the mass shooting in El Paso.</span></p>
