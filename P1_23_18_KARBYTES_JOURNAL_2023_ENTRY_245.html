<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_245</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Today karbytes updated its payment methods for its 24 Hour Fitness gym membership subscription and for its OpenAI ChatGPT API usage using exactly one debit card for most transactions. karbytes has yet to replace its missing key to the house where karbytes currently legally lives and is not likely going to ask the owner of that house for a replacement key because karbytes has no reason to go there other than to retrieve backup items in case current ones become unusable by karbytes (and karbytes prefers to have enough money saved up from working to replace lost, stolen, or damaged electronics and survival gear by ordering those items to be picked up by karbytes in local retail outlets such as Best Buy).</p>
<p>Summary of karbytes expenses:</p>
<p>1. AT&amp;T Monthly <span style="background:#ffff00">Phone</span> and Mobile Data Bill ($30/month for basic phone usage (i.e. calling and texting) and $20/3 gigabytes of additional &#8220;high speed&#8221; mobile <span style="background:#00ff00">Internet</span> usage).</p>
<p>2. 24 Hour Fitness <span style="background:#00ff00">Gym</span> Membership and <span style="background:#ffff00">Showering</span> ($50/month for local gym access).</p>
<p>3. Coin <span style="background:#ffff00">Laundry</span> (approximately $5 using quarters per wash/dry cycle).</p>
<p>4. <span style="background:#ffff00">Food</span>, Medicine, Transportation (e.g. BART train fare), Apparel (e.g. shoes), Survival Gear (e.g. camping backpack), <span style="background:#00ff00">Education</span> (e.g. online classes, books, renting a movie, using ChatGPT), and Miscellaneous (e.g. green laser pointer with USB charger).</p>
